        The following FAQ has been assembled in order to give information which outlines the product vision during Summer 2020.
      </p>
      <p className="c4"><span className="c9">Description of the product: What will the MVP be in 8 weeks? * </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c12">Opinionpedia.org is a public survey site.</span><span className="c1">&nbsp;As a non-profit organization our mission is to create a publicly owned repository of peoples&rsquo; opinions, both living and dead, the website will then illustrate these opinions using a gamut of charts and diagrams, in order to make public consciousness more visible. </span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">By the end of summer (8 weeks) the application will be offering a basic user experience to create an account, vote on questions and share personal demographic information. The MVP will launch with 100,000 prepopulated questions for users to vote on, and will feature dynamic SEO optimized. The front-end application will be equipped with components that display previously submitted votes, and will render differently based on a variety of conditions such as the voter&rsquo;s gender, ethnicity, occupation, or sexuality. </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Our project will focus on using components from plottable.js and blueprint.js to reduce development and design time, Gatsby for SEO, and Node.js and MySQL on the back-end for ease of adoption.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">Why does your idea matter: How will it help deliver on the full promise of the internet, or make the internet more awesome? * </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Everyday the internet is making it easier to answer certain queries better: </span></p><p className="c2 c21"><span className="c1"></span></p><ul className="c20 lst-kix_3bux1xxwada0-0 start"><li className="c0"><span className="c1">&quot;Which product is better - X or Y?&quot;</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">&ldquo;How do I treat a mild fever?&rdquo;</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">&ldquo;What is a healthy diet for a stout body?&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">threads, blogs, videos, and memes have all been created to share information on queries such as these. On the surface the internet presents a clear answer, &lsquo;here look at this webpage&rsquo;. However, an investigation into the comments or youtube recommendations may send you down a rabbit hole where you are exposed to extraordinary ideas.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c12">This has proven to be a deadly phenomenon. The New York Times is currently releasing a multi part series on this very phenomenon called Rabbit Hole (</span><span className="c12 c15"><a className="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1593997153316000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1F0StDlU-LVV94lVi5sj5e">https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole</a></span><span className="c1">) where misinformation is radicalizing individuals from all walks of life. Some may say that violent, polarizing content is a natural product of free speech on the internet, to which we at Opinionpedia.org see as a reasonable stance; however, the propagation of toxic content does not mean that people need to be radicalized. According to to the article Classifying, Measuring, and Predicting Users&rsquo; Overall Active Behavior On Social Networking Sites, written by researchers Chen, Lu, Chau, and Gupta in 2014, states that content on social media which triggers trong emotions such as anger, anxiety, and joy are much more likely to be shared then content which is melancholy or unstimulating. The reason why opinionpedia is so awesome is because we are 100% focused on taking real quantifiable data from around the world and creating information from it for the public benefit.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">The example questions given earlier represents the majority of questions being asked today on the internet, these are questions that require expertise and thus could be answered by a small group of individuals. Unfortunately there are still questions the internet does not answer. &nbsp;Here are a few examples &quot;How old were you when you smoked your first cigarette?&quot;, &quot;Have you ever felt afraid to call the police?&quot;, &quot;Are you insecure about your sexual orientation?&quot;. These emotional questions have nothing to do with credentials or expertise - everyone&#39;s answers are valid, deliberate, and critical to uniting people from all over the world.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">We at Opinionpedia.org think that textbooks, lectures, and social media are overrated. Humans can only consider so much as once, we have a bandwidth issue. It&#39;s time to transcend dialogue and memes, content reflective of individual creators, instead it&#39;s time for humanity to embrace a new medium - graphs, which allow us to see the position of millions instantaneously. The aim of Opinionpedia.org is to be a research tool, dedicated to collecting and safeguarding the opinions of all conscious individuals, then to create dynamic and legible information with that data for the benefit of all. In particular we hope that the information we create will bring peace of mind for individuals overwhelmed by fear, anxiety for issues both internal and external.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">We believe that our product will help educate our visitors by growing their perspective of the world, and potentially contradicting their perception of the world. This claim is based on the psychology of prejudice and stereotypes, contemporary challenges such as misinformation, prejudice, and civil unrest. Because Opinionpedia.org is so focused on creating a new educational resource, which is focused identifying, collecting, and displaying the opinion of others inside of compact images. This unique value proposition is poised to no only help the internet better answer questions, it will also help people too impatient to read the opinions of other quickly understand the opinions of thousands instantaneously.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Bypass critical problems in attention span</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">Who are your users or potential users? * </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Opinionpedia.org is a tool for humanity. We want to become a tuning fork for mass consciousness both past and present. Thus we hope to appeal to as diverse an audience as possible. With this in mind we can look at Opinionpedia.org from multiple perspectives. Opinionpedia.org can be viewed</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">A more pragmatic answer to this question is that Opinionpedia.org is a tool for market researchers, marketers, students, educators, politicians, activists, and governments. Because Opinionpedia.org is focused on creating legible information we foresee our primary users as individuals who are seeking some kind of validation or prop to aid in their rhetoric or research.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">What is your personal connection to the service &amp; the user group you are planning to reach with your product? * </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">For the past seven years, I have been been developing mockups, slide decks, and MVPs for the project currently known as Opinionpedia.org. I began my journey with the product began at 20, frustrated by all of the misinformation that I had seen on the internet. Conspiracy theories about 911, Monsanto, and metaphysics seemed to consume my Facebook feed. I asked my friends, on social media, if they believed the articles. &nbsp;There response were interesting people shared affirmative remarks, other made jokes. Then I decided to speak with people in-person about some of these wild ideas, this generally made people very uncomfortable. It is out of this frustration that Opinionpedia.org was born. For the past seven years (7 years) I have been acquiring knowledge, skills, and allies to help me accomplish the make this website a reality, and plan to continue for many more years.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">If we do not fund this project, will your team still work on it? To what extent?</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">We anticipate that Opinionpedia.org will be developed over the course of the next 5 - 20 years. After which time we suspect our board would be consumed by a larger organization. For the time being without sufficient funds Opinionpedia.org will be developed every summer and winter for about 3 months out of every year. Currently Opionpedia.org is in our summertime sprint. Our four-man team began work in early May, 2020. We plan to do a soft launch on June 20, 2020, and we will continue development using continuous integration until the end of August. </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">Why did you pick this idea? Do you have domain expertise? How do you know people need what you&rsquo;re building? </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">We feel that Opinionpedia.org has always been needed by society. We feel that misinformation is a real threat to the future the internet as well as humanity. What&rsquo;s more we feel that everyday people needlessly suffer from ignorance, and that we can make a major contribution to the solution. So why now? I, as the evangelist for this project, needed time to gather resources for the coming trials as an entrepreneur. Today, I have never been more confident in my ability to define this product, this is because I have just finish school at SJSU with a degree in mathematics &ndash; what&rsquo;s more I begin work as a software engineer at the end of August so it is time to take vigorous action. More over my cofounders, Paul Merrill, and Thomas Shepherd with whom I have worked with for over 5 years now &ndash; on this exact project, understand the level of commitment necessary and do not baulk at the responsibilities. Lastly, Opinionpedia.org is in the perfect position to establish a foothold in the SEO ecosystem, failure to act now could mean that for-profit companies will seize the keywords and phrases we are targeting, this not only undermines our business, it could spoil the chance that the public has at a centralized repository for our opinions, mass consciousness.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">Are you looking for any teammates? If so, please indicate what skills or roles you seek.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">We are looking for board members, mentors, or part-time team members to provide technical insight and leadership for our team. We feel that our 4-man team can meet the given project specification. If we were to be sponsored by Mozilla, we hope that the MVP Lab would define more clearly, and prepare us for the path to success.</span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Desired skills: </span></p><ul className="c20 lst-kix_tbup2laik1of-0 start"><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Non-profit administration</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Data Engineering</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Information Security</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">SEO</span></li></ul><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">Describe your work plan. *</span></p><ul className="c20 lst-kix_5d8i9z7btmq0-0 start"><li className="c0"><span className="c9">Describe the approach the team will take to develop the Minimum Viable Product throughout the summer. This includes, but not limited to: </span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c9">*Who are your competitors?*</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c9">*How will you attract your first 1000 users? Your first 1,000,000?*</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c9">First 2 week development milestone</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c9">Tech stack you plan to use (Cloud services, APIs, mobile platforms, languages, etc)</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c9">Link to simple sketches (can be as simple as paper and pencil) of your product or idea</span></li></ul><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">The team at Opinionpedia.org is composed primarily by 4 team members. One (1) Back-end engineer, two (2) front-end Developers, and one (1) data scientist. Our sprint began in mid-May, and our team is approximately 10 days from doing a soft launch. Although the product is not a complete MVP the goal of this soft launch is to allow us to gather feedback on the user interface, and begin SEO optimization.</span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">The remaining 7 or 8 weeks of summer will accomplishing the follow: </span></p><ul className="c20 lst-kix_it4t0dr8pl59-0 start"><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Populate the database with 150,000 programmatically created survey questions</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Refining the UI/UX to promote users generating content for the site</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Create export functionality so that infographics can be shared on different platforms</span></li><li className="c0"><span className="c1">Create algorithms that dynamically calculate statistics to from available information</span></li></ul><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">The strategy for acquiring our first 1000 lies in our SEO strategy. This is our secret sauce. As outline in &ldquo;Why does your idea matter?&rdquo; we claimed that the internet does not answer certain questions. Well the 150,000 questions we plan to generate will all be target this certain type of questions, which we define as a collective questions, which means a good answer must be composed of many small answers. Let me give some more examples of collective questions, &ldquo;Is common core better than previous public school curriculum?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where is the best place to raise children&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is Donald Trump a good president&rdquo;. The internet is currently focused on providing a narrated response to these questions, but we are doing is creating a quantitative response. We feel that search engines and the public will be drawn to our detailed and informative infographics. As such we plan to create a large breadth of static pages containing content of interest to the public so that during the fall and early winter of 2020 our site will begin to gain traction due to a high SEO score for a variety of phrases. This organic traffic will create a positive feedback loop where our team is able to optimize the user experience leading to a lower churn rate, and more user generated content. We anticipate 1000 monthly active users by summer 2021, and 1,000,000 users the Fall of 2024. </span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">_____________</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c9">What challenges do you anticipate with this idea? *</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c9"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">The most immediate obstacle I see for this company becoming a success is that we do not have the opinionpedia.com domain name.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Opinionpedia.org is currently run by a 4 man team. Given that we are both entry level professional and hobby programmers, we have a good idea of the road ahead of us, for about 2 months, After this time we are unsure as to what our most pressing needs will be. Given our lack of experience we are ot only concerned by technical challenges, we are also unconcerned about the operation and responsibilities of a non-profit organization.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1"></span></p><p className="c4"><span className="c1">Some specific challenges that may await us are:</span></p><ul className="c20 lst-kix_dr12aaimajrw-0 start"><li
